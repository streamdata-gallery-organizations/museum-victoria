description: Museum Victoria is Australia&rsquo;s largest public museum organisation.
  As the state museum for Victoria, we are responsible for looking after the State
  collection of nearly 17 million objects, documents, photographs and specimens. Our
  research, in the fields of science and humanities, uses the museum&rsquo;s collections
  and expert staff to further what we know about the social and natural history of
  Victoria and beyond.
